## You have not found a notifier that you need? ➡️ Create your own notifier

### Python

The easiest way to do this is to use the template repository: [simbashlog-example-notifier](https://github.com/fuchs-fabian/simbashlog-example-notifier)

If you have a special use case, try to use the template repository as much as possible, but save yourself a lot of problems by at least making sure to use the following repository: [simbashlog-notify-helper-py](https://github.com/fuchs-fabian/simbashlog-notify-helper-py)

## Bugs, Suggestions, Feedback, and Needed Support

> If you have any bugs, suggestions or feedback, feel free to create an issue or create a pull request with your changes.

Especially if another notifier is desired, it is advisable to create it and then include it here for this repository in the README. It is best to create a pull request for this. Before this is then included here in this repository, the code is viewed and the README is read from the notifier repository. Comments and improvement requests are then made in the PR.

It is recommended to specify at least the following topic in the repository: [`simbashlog-notifier`](https://github.com/topics/simbashlog-notifier)

Other topics can be taken from the [template repository](https://github.com/fuchs-fabian/simbashlog-example-notifier). Here it is generally advisable to specify the topics for the notifier as appropriately as possible.
